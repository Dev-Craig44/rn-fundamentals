# Styling

# Borders

To summarize the section on borders:

- **Border Width**: Controls the thickness of the border.
- **Border Color**: Sets the color of the border.
- **Border Radius**: Rounds the corners of the border.
- **Border Style**: Defines the style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted).

Example:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderColor: "blue",
    borderRadius: 10,
    borderStyle: "solid",
  },
});
```

# Shadows

Shadows in React Native differ between iOS and Android. Here's how to apply them effectively:

## iOS Shadows

To create shadows on iOS, you need to define at least the following properties:

- **`shadowColor`**: Specifies the color of the shadow.
- **`shadowOffset`**: Determines the shadow's position. It requires an object with `width` and `height` values.
- **`shadowOpacity`**: Controls the transparency of the shadow.
- **`shadowRadius`**: Defines the blur radius of the shadow.

Example:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    shadowColor: "grey",
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 10 },
    shadowOpacity: 1,
    shadowRadius: 10,
  },
});
```

## Android Shadows

On Android, shadows are controlled using the **`elevation`** property. Unlike iOS, Android does not provide as much control over shadow properties.

Example:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    elevation: 10,
  },
});
```

### Key Differences

- iOS offers more granular control over shadows with multiple properties.
- Android simplifies shadow implementation but limits customization to the `elevation` property.

# Paddings and Margins

Understanding the difference between padding and margin is crucial for layout design:

- **Padding**: The space between the content of a component and its border. It creates internal spacing within the component.
- **Margin**: The space outside the component's border. It defines the external spacing between the component and other elements.

Visualizing these concepts can help you design cleaner and more organized layouts.

# Styling Text

When working with text styling in React Native, here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Custom Fonts**: To use custom fonts, refer to the [Expo Custom Fonts documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-custom-fonts/). Expo provides an easy way to load and use custom fonts in your project.
- **Invalid Properties**: Be cautious when applying styles. For example, setting `fontSize` on a `View` component is invalid because `fontSize` is not a supported property for `View`. React Native does not throw errors for unsupported style properties, but they will simply have no effect.
- **No Style Inheritance**: Unlike CSS in web development, React Native does not support style inheritance. This means that styles applied to a parent component do not automatically propagate to child components. Each component must explicitly define its own styles.

These principles will help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure your text styling behaves as expected.

## âœ¨ Encapsulating Styles

> **How can we make sure our text looks consistent across different screens?**

We solve this by **encapsulating styles** inside reusable components. Instead of repeating styles on every `Text` element, we create a custom wrapper component.

- `rsf` â†’ create a React functional component
- `imrn` â†’ import React Native components
- `rns` â†’ generate a React Native `StyleSheet`

### âœ… AppText Component

We wrap React Nativeâ€™s `Text` component to create a reusable `AppText` that automatically applies consistent styling across all screens.

```tsx
// AppText.tsx
// rsf + imrn + rns combo
import React from "react";
import { Platform, StyleSheet, Text } from "react-native";

function AppText(props) {
  return <Text style={styles.text}>{props.children}</Text>;
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontFamily: Platform.OS === "android" ? "Roboto" : "Avenir",
  },
});

export default AppText;
```
